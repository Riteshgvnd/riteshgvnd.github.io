**Hi, Welecome to my page!! **

I am Ritesh, from [Chhindwara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chhindwara), a small city in Madhya Pradesh. I completed my B.E. from [SGSITS, Indore](http://www.sgsits.ac.in/) in the Electronics & Telecommunication. Currently I am pursuing M. Tech from Computer Science and Engineering department at [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/). After coming to IITB I have taken courses in various fields like Machine Learning and Computer Architecture and my M. Tech project topic is also combination of thse two fields, which is  "Developing Machine Learning techniques for improving Cache Performance".

I am part of **Casper (Computer Architecture for Security and Performance)** research team, working under the guidance of [Prof. Biswabandan Panda](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~biswa/) , where our team is working to design advanced techniques to improve system performance.  

Apart from that I am a huge Pink Floyd fan, I also love to travel (who doesn't :P) and read about random topics on wikipedia. 

Anyway, please feel free to contact me for any technical or non-technical discussions.
