**Hi, Welcome to my page!!**

I am Ritesh, I am pursuing M. Tech from Computer Science and Engineering department at [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/). As an E&TC graduate I explored various fields of Computer Science at IIT-B. I took up courses on Machine Learning and Computer Architecture and my M.Tech project topic is also a combination of these two fields, which is  "Developing Machine Learning techniques for improving Cache Performance". Through this topic I am exploring two different research areas of Computer Science and It is very interesting to learn how complex techniques of ML can inspire improvements in Micro-architecture.

I am part of a research team  **CASPER (Computer Architecture for Security and Performance)**, under the guidance of [Prof. Biswabandan Panda](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~biswa/), our team is working to design advanced techniques to improve system performance. Our team is always open for new members where we can guide each other and learn together. Follow this [link](https://riteshgvnd.github.io/projects/) for my academic projects and also view works being done at [CASPER](https://casper-iitb.github.io/).  

Apart from that,I am from [Chhindwara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chhindwara), a small city in Madhya Pradesh. I completed my B.E. from [SGSITS, Indore](http://www.sgsits.ac.in/) in Electronics & Telecommunication. I am a huge Pink Floyd fan, I also love to travel (who doesn't :P) and I also pass my time reading history and science related articles on internet. 

Anyway, please feel free to contact me for any technical or non-technical discussions.
