1.Developing Machine Learning techniques for improving Cache Performance (MTech Project at IITB, still in development ) 
====== 
* Cache includes various components and policies which can be improvised using Machine Learning.
* Working on applying Machine Learning to a cache component called **Prefetcher**.
* Main aim is to improve address predictions of Prefetcher such that it can learn the behaviour of applications.

2.Movie Plot Generator
====== 
* A Deep Learning based model which can generate a small plot or story.
* Plots are Genre specific and model takes genre as the input.  
* Makes an effective use of GPT-2 transformer.

  
3.Key-Value Server
====== 
* A server where client can interact with server in key-values format. 
* A multi-threaded server which can serve miltiple requests simultaneously.

4.Driver & Vehicle Safety System
======
* An Embedded system with GPS interface to locate driver
* Alcohol Detector with buzzer in case of Drunk Driving

5.Data Acquisition System: Navigation Robot
======
* A Bot created with a collision detection sysytem
* A real time GSM/CDMA connection with Server
* Continous tracing and acquisition of Bots's coordinates through GPS And GSM Interface
